# QuickScript.js

QuickScript is a client-side javascript framework which extends Knockout.js to provide full application managment, including data models, view routing, and html templates. It was written mainly because I wanted to use Knockout, but wanted to make conventions on top of it to keep my code DRY.

QuickScript allows you to render your entire web application client-side.

QuickScript is written in CoffeeScript, so get familiar with it [here](http://coffeescript.org).

It is also heavily based on Knockout.js, so get familiar with it [here](http://knockoutjs.com).
